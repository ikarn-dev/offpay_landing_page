  {
    question: "How do offline payments work without internet?",
    answer:
      "The app prepares durable nonce payment slots while online. In offline mode it builds and signs a stablecoin transfer locally, shares the request or signed payload by QR or nearby BLE, encrypts the pending transaction, and settles it when connectivity returns.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do offline and private payments work with every token?",
    answer:
      "No. The implemented private and offline P2P layer is stablecoin-only: USDC or USDT. SOL is reserved for network fees. Jupiter swaps can use supported swap tokens when the swap capability is available.",
  },
  {
    question: "What does OffPay verify before signing?",
    answer:
      "The client verifies route-specific transaction details before signing. Offline payments verify nonceAdvance first, signer, recipient, amount, token, and signatures. Private sends verify signer, mint, amount, recipient, and private-route metadata.",
  },
  {
    question: "Who holds my funds?",
    answer:
      "You do. Wallet secrets stay in device storage and are gated by local passcode or biometrics when enabled. OffPay never has access to your funds or private keys.",
  },
  {
    question: "Does the mobile app call Helius, Jupiter, MagicBlock, or QuickNode directly?",
    answer:
      "No. The client uses https://api.offpay.app for authenticated API calls, RPC proxying, wallet data, risk, swaps, private payments, pending backups, capabilities, and settlement. Provider credentials stay server-side.",
  },
  {
    question: "What happens if a private or offline payment cannot submit right away?",
    answer:
      "The signed transaction blob is encrypted into the pending backup queue. Private-send retryable failures can upload the backup immediately; offline handoffs keep the queue local until reconnect. The settlement engine retries and clears confirmed items.",
  },
  {
    question: "Where does Umbra fit?",
    answer:
      "Umbra powers supported shielded stablecoin actions in the client: register the encrypted-balance account, query supported shielded balances, shield, and withdraw. Pending UTXO scans now reconcile against the on-chain Umbra nullifier-set accounts so claimed UTXOs stay hidden even after a cold boot or reinstall. Signing, key material, and proof/decryption state stay client-side.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can OffPay work manually offline forever?",
    answer:
      "No. Offline payment setup requires an online preparation step, and settlement requires reconnecting. Manual offline mode intentionally blocks backend and network requests.",
  },
